# TinderAutoSwiper
A python script that autoswipes for you

There's 2 files that's required for this to work.
    ChromeDriver & Selenium.
        
    pip install selenium
    Download https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads , unpack, move it to your lib directory.
    
 It has a random function for Likes/Dislikes so it doesn't get flagged as a bot and banned (hopefully).
 Good luck and please steal my project. lol.
